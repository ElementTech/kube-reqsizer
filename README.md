# kube-reqsizer
![alt text](/assets/example.png)

**kube-reqsizer** is a kubernetes controller that will measure the usage of pods over time and reduce their requests based on the average usage.

## Description

Kube-reqsizer has two primary custom flags:

```
-annotation-filter bool
    
    Enable a annotation filter for pod scraping. 
    Enabling this will ensure that the controller 
    only sets requests of controllers of which pods have the annotation. 
    (auto.request.operator/optimize=true)

-sample-size int

    The sample size to create an average from when reconciling. (default 1)
```

Sample size is the amount of data-points the controller will store in cache before constructing an average for the pod. After a requests resizing, the cache will clean itself and a new average will be calculated based on the sample size.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster



~~1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:~~ _this controller does not use CRDs_

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kube-reqsizer:tag
```
	
2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kube-reqsizer:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the controller into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
